* What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I learned a huge amount about CSS postioning by doing this exercise. For example when doing this exercise, I started out using borders right off the bat to know when elements started and ended. I also spent a fair amount of time trying to make the padding and margins look appealing.

* What did you learn about CSS positioning?

I have prior experiance to css and positioning. It reminded me that its one of the most difficult things to master. But after going through this weeks exercises, I think I finally understand the difference between the kinds of positioning. The other thing that it made me realize is that, Sometimes when designing/positioning a website you have to alter the HTML semantics to make the CSS be clean.

* What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

The easiest part was definately the images and the text styling changes. The hardest part was making the footer stay at the bottom of the page if the window changed size, and so that it didn't overwrite the main content of the page when the window got smaller.

* What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I have to say that this was the most time consuming assignment that I have done for Dev BootCamp so far. I learned that its very important to work on one thing at a time. Also, work on the things that matter the most first. For example, work on the general specific layout first, then work on what color you want the font to be.
