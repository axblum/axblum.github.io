So I have never been a fan of blogging. But here goes my first post. Like most people who start blogging,one tipically does a "Welcome Post". So here it goes. I think this first post will be about how this site came to be. Once opon a time I had a domain, but it was such a pain to maintain and update that it slowly became static and finally, I decided to no longer pay for the domain and its hosting fees, cancelling the accounts. I figured that because I am trying to learn tricks of the trade for webdev/ruby. I should have a place to store / show my work, once I complete Devbootcamp
