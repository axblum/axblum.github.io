So if you have been following along with my blog posts. Last week I wrote a blog post about Ruby classes. So I am gonna continue with the example that I used last week. If you look at the code below, you will see a Ruby class of Money.

```ruby
class Money
def initialize(denomination,serial_number,country)
  @denomination = denomination
  @serial_number = serial_number
  end
end
```

The same object would created in JavaScript like so:


```js
function Money(denomination,serial,country){
this.denomination = denomination,
this.serial_number = serial_number,
this.country = country
}
```

For review one would create a new Money class in Ruby like so:.

 ```ruby
jackson = Money.new(100,"1234","US")
```
In JavaScript this would be achieved by doing the following:

```js
jackson = new Money(100,"1234","US")
```
Now lets take the valid method for the Money class in Ruby, seen below.

```ruby
def valid
  if @serial_number.size = 10
    true
  else
    false
  end
end
```

This is where one of the major differences between Ruby classes and the JavaScript Constructor Function differ between the languages. One can create a function that is available to all of the Money objects in JavaScript however it can't be done within the Constructor function. This would be achieved by creating a prototype in Javascript. A prototype is a JavaScript function that is available to all objects of that type. It can be done like so:

```js
Money.prototype.valid = function() {
    if(this.serial_number.length == 10)
        return true;
    }
};
```

This will give every Money JS object the ability to check whether its valid or not.
